# Teacher Tool


This is a project that I made in 8 hours for a hackathon  (don't judge too harshly for the bad code, UI and security haha).


More information about this project can be found on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/teacher-tool).


`/server` contains the code for the server (written in node.js and express).

`/webapp` contains the code for the web application (written in javascript, react, and MUI).

Feel free to open a PR or issue to address anything.
